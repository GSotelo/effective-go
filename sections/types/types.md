Go uses static typing, requiring you to define a variable’s data type when declaring it. This approach helps identify mistakes early in the development cycle. Go’s core data types can be divided into the following main categories:

- Predeclared Types
  - Numeric Types
    - [Integer](predeclared/integer.md)
- Composite Types
  - Arrays
  - Slices
