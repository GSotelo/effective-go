# What are pointers?

In Go, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

## Zero value

The zero value is nil, indicating that the pointer doesn’t reference any memory location yet.


## Fun facts

The pointer will always be of a fixed size (4 or 8 bytes) regardless of the type it points to.
