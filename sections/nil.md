# What is nil?

In Go, `nil` is a predeclared identifier available in the universal block. It is frequently used to denote the zero value of several types, including pointers, channels, functions, interfaces, maps, and slices.

## Error handling
Go follows a convention where functions return an error as their final return value. If the error is nil, it means the operation was successful; if it's not nil, it signals a failure. This approach promotes clear and straightforward error handling. Instead of relying on exceptions or special error codes like in Java, Python, or C#, Go adopts a minimalist and explicit model where errors are treated as regular return values.
