# How Go Uses Implicit Interfaces

In Go, types automatically satisfy interfaces if they implement the required methodsâ€”no explicit declaration needed. This means you can define interfaces at the point of consumption rather than at the point of implementation:

In many languages like Java or C#, you must explicitly declare that a type implements an interface. In Go, there's no such declaration. If a type has the methods an interface requires, it automatically satisfies that interface:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Move is an interface â€” any type with a Use() method satisfies it
type Move interface {
    Use()
}

// Thunderbolt automatically implements Move
type Thunderbolt struct{}

func (t Thunderbolt) Use() {
    fmt.Println("âš¡ Pikachu used Thunderbolt!")
}

// QuickAttack automatically implements Move
type QuickAttack struct{}

func (q QuickAttack) Use() {
    fmt.Println("ðŸ’¨ Eevee used Quick Attack!")
}

// performMove accepts anything that satisfies the Move interface
func performMove(m Move) {
    m.Use()
}

func main() {
    t := Thunderbolt{}
    q := QuickAttack{}

    performMove(t) // âš¡ Pikachu used Thunderbolt!
    performMove(q) // ðŸ’¨ Eevee used Quick Attack!
}
```

## Zero Declaration Overhead
Thunderbolt automatically satisfies `Move` just by having a `Use()` method. No boilerplate, no explicit declarationsâ€”it just works.

```go
type Thunderbolt struct{}
func (t Thunderbolt) Use() {
    fmt.Println("âš¡ Pikachu used Thunderbolt!")
}
```
## Interface Defined at Point of Need
The interface serves the consumer's needs. If `performMove` only needs `Use()`, that's all the interface requiresâ€”even if moves could have other methods like `GetPower()` or `GetType()`.

```go
// The Move interface is defined where it's consumed (in performMove)
// not where it's implemented (Thunderbolt/QuickAttack)
func performMove(m Move) {
    m.Use()
}
```

## Effortless Extensibility

You can add new move types from anywhere in your codebase (or even external packages) and they automatically work with existing functions.

```go
// Add new move types without touching existing code
type Flamethrower struct{}
func (f Flamethrower) Use() {
    fmt.Println("ðŸ”¥ Charizard used Flamethrower!")
}

type Splash struct{}
func (s Splash) Use() {
    fmt.Println("ðŸ’§ Magikarp used Splash! But nothing happened...")
}

func main() {
    // These work immediately with performMove - no code changes needed!
    performMove(Flamethrower{})
    performMove(Splash{})
}
```
## Key Points

`Thunderbolt` and `QuickAttack` have no idea they implement `Move`â€”they just happen to have a `Use()` method. This makes the code:

- Flexible: Easy to add new moves
- Testable: Simple to mock
- Maintainable: Low coupling between components
- Natural: Follows how we think about behavior

This is why Go's implicit interfaces make dependency injection feel effortlessâ€”it's just good design falling into place naturally.
